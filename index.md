Welcome to London Infosec! We are a consortium of academics in London (and our friends/collaborators elsewhere in UK, and all over the world) working on Infosec.

<h2 id="resources"> Resources </h2>

You can join our resources if you have a *.ac.uk email address, or if you know someone with a *.ac.uk who is happy to be your reference. Slack has a whitelist style subscription model. We have added a few "seed" university email domains, but if you're unable to join because your university is missing from the list, please let us know! For all enquiries, email us on **london.infosec[AT]gmail[DOT]com**
