Welcome to London Infosec! We are a consortium of people working on infosec, from both academia and industry, in London (and our friends/collaborators elsewhere in the UK, and all over the world).

<h2 id="resources"> Resources </h2>

If you fit the above description, we would love to have you join us!

We have a mailing-list and a Slack channel. At the moment, the mailing-list is quite active and the Slack channel is rather quiet :-) Anyone can join the mailing-list. Slack has a whitelist style subscription model. We have added a few "seed" organizational (mostly university) email domains, but if you're unable to join, please let us know! For all enquiries, email us on **london.infosec[AT]gmail[DOT]com**
